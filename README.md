# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh





During the 30-day hackathon, we will build a Regulatory Compliance Management Platform designed to transform how businesses manage and maintain compliance with data protection regulations. This platform will act as a central hub for tracking regulatory requirements, conducting audits, and monitoring compliance status.

Our solution will feature an AI-Powered Regulatory Assistant that delivers real-time, customized guidance based on a business’s industry, location, and size. This assistant will keep businesses updated on regulatory changes automatically, eliminating the need for manual monitoring and ensuring they stay compliant with minimal effort.

We’ll also include an Automated Document Drafting module that simplifies the creation of legal documents like NDAs and privacy policies. By using customizable templates, this feature will make it easy for businesses to generate and update essential compliance documents quickly, reducing the need for extensive legal expertise.

The platform will incorporate a Compliance Risk Scoring Dashboard that evaluates and displays compliance health through a dynamic score based on data handling practices, security measures, and employee training. It will offer actionable insights and recommendations to help businesses address risks and improve their compliance posture.

Our Compliance Alerts and Updates system will also continuously monitor changes in data protection laws and provide timely alerts for necessary policy adjustments. This ensures businesses can swiftly adapt to new regulations, keeping their compliance up to date without manual intervention.

By integrating these advanced features, our platform will offer a seamless and efficient approach to compliance management, addressing the complexities of regulatory requirements and making compliance easier for businesses of all sizes.


The unique challenge we are trying to solve is the challenge of managing and maintaining compliance with data protection regulations, which can be fragmented and complex. Businesses often struggle with staying updated on changing regulations, as it can be overwhelming. Existing tools usually don’t work together well, making it hard to get a full view of compliance. Drafting and updating legal documents like NDAs, privacy policies, and terms and conditions is time-consuming and often requires legal expertise. Identifying and addressing compliance risks proactively can also be difficult without real-time insights. Small to medium-sized businesses often lack the resources to manage compliance effectively. Our platform aims to simplify these tasks by providing a unified solution that makes compliance management easier and more efficient.
